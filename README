The ClipBoard class is designed to be a node plugin and a wrapper over the flash movie
to copy text contents to the OS clipboard. The class will place the flash movie below the given
node so that a user action can trigger the copy of contents to the OS clip board using
Flash's System.setClipboard method. Starting from flash 10, the clipboard can be set only
off a user initiated event. So the JS class shall only set the string to be copied and will
allow the flash movie's event to capture the user action and set the clipboard contents.
